## The Design Problem

In a centralized world, all content is managed by a single provider. It controls
when and where data is stored.

However, peer-to-peer applications like BitTorrent flip this concept on it's
head. There is no single provider who decides when and wehre data is stored; instead,
anyone with access to the data can choose to rehost it to others at their
discresion. Similarly, in federated applications, it's hard to know when and
how your data is being shared between instances.

This has marked benefits -- it means that the most popular information is more
resilient to outages and censorship, as users do not depend upon a single
provider hosting the data, and instead can ask multiple providers (either
peer-to-peer or federated instances) for the data.

However, this causes problems for long-term data access -- if data is not
popular, it can become obsolete or disappear from the network.

## The Design Solution

- Allow users to set **parameters** for what to host. For example, "host until
  next week" or "share only users with property X". This can also be useful when
  trying to improve application or protocol performance if there are many
  users on the network.
- **Create incentives** that encourage hosting less popular content. For example,
  "Users who share datasets with less than 5 peers get a free gold account."

### Examples

- Disappearing messages
- Nextcloud retention
- BitTorrent trackers

## Why Choose Conditional Sharing?

When there is a large amount of information on the network with varied relevance and popularity.

## Best Practices: How to Implement Conditional Sharing?

- Ensure you use a protocol & library that allows you to control with whom data is shared
  and when, including individual blocks.
- Create smart defaults based on the type of information and group dynamics of
  your application, but allow users to modify this easily using sliders and
  toggles.

## Potential Problems with Conditional Sharing

- There are maybe still copies of data after the conditions are no longer met.

## The Take-Away

Conditional sharing helps users collectively keep data online when it needs to be without a central coordinator.
