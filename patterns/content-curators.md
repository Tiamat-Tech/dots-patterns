## The Design Problem

In a decentralized social network, people cannot (or should not) rely on
centralized artificial intelligence algorithms to recommend what should be viewed next in
their feed. Socila network providers struggle to decide between displaying
everything and allowing users to choose certain
filter options. This requires a lot of overhead in managing user feeds, and
restricts user choice in what they are able to see.

## The Design Solution

Users can pick third-party organizations, providers, or services to curate
their content feed. Make it easy for developers to write programs that provide
curation for social network feeds. Allow users to go their settings and choose
the what algorithm they want to use.

### Examples

- Twitter lists
- Are.na
- Mastodon 'Who's on this instance'

## Why Choose Content Curators?

- When you want to give users choice, flexibility, and control over feeds.
- When you want to enable an ecosystem or marketplace of filters & algorithms.

## Best Practices: How to Implement Content Curators?

- Only place trusted and verified third parties in the role of content curators.
- Allow users to access more interesting and relevant content and therefore
  fosters a stronger and meaningful relationship with their network.

## Potential Problems with Content Curators?

- Keep in mind that not all media and news organisations are necessarily good
  at curating content. In addition, the majority of them might tend to have
  some certain biases and or positions.
- The level of content relevance and stability will vary and can poorly affect
  the user experience if content curators are not vetted properly or if it is difficult to use.

## The Take-Away

This is more of an opt-in option rather than a catch-all solution for curating feeds.
