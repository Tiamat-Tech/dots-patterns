Typically, decentralized applications share everything publicly by default. However, this assumption limits use cases to a narrow set of possibilities and limits user trust in the application, reducing adoption. These patterns help build trust with the application by providing methods for users to decide who sees what and when.

With sharing and permissions, people feel more comfortable to communicate more authentically with each other. In physical space, we negotiate and change our behavior with varying levels of privacy depending on where we are -- from the bedroom, to the cafe, to the public park. Virtual spaces should mimic these through clear choices about who will see what and when.
